As my first post and considering it is a new year I would like to talk about some of the things I’d like to change and/or work on in the coming months, my resolution you could say, and I feel like if I blog about it I will commit that much more. I will be focused on my development of websites and apps, basically just getting better!

Here recently I just started to join the automation bandwagon, more specifically using [Grunt.js]. Grunt is basically a task-based command line tool you write using JavaScript and it’s built on top of Node.js. Up to the time before I started building this blog, I just used Grunt to combine CSS files and minify them, which is elementary compared to the other possibilities with Grunt. Now, after completing this site (for the most part), I feel like I have a descent Grunt workflow. In the coming months I want to expand more on the possibilities with automation in my workflow, and ultimately have a solid process that works for me and my projects.

Anyone in the web design community will know that JavaScript has come a long way and with the likes of frameworks such as [Ember.js], [Angular.js], [Meteor.js], etc. its almost crazy not to have a MVC framework under your belt. This year I would like to find one of the above or possibly some other framework that works for me to build apps easily as possible. I would also like to get in the habit of writing pure Javascript, when possible, in order to learn how the language works besides jumping straight to jQuery for simple tasks.

Mainly I just like to get better at what I do and continue learning, and never stopping! Oh, yeah and continue blogging on here.
