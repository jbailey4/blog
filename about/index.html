		<p>
			I'm Josh Bailey, a web designer/developer in <del>Columbia</del> Cola, South Carolina. I currently work for the Army doing all sorts of things, from E-learning web related-work to mobile app development (using <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>). I also do some freelance work from time-to-time and work on various web projects as often as possible. When not consumed by web development, I'm usually skateboarding, playing with my dogs, and/or hanging with my <a href="http://www.brookemcalinden.wordpress.com/">girlfriend, Brooke</a>.
