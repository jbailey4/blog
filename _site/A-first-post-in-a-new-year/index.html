				<p>As my first post and considering it is a new year I would like to talk about some of the things I’d like to change and/or work on in the coming months, my resolution you could say, and I feel like if I blog about it I will commit that much more. I will be focused on my development of websites and apps, basically just getting better!</p>

<p>Here recently I just started to join the automation bandwagon, more specifically using <a href="%09http://www.gruntjs.com/">Grunt.js</a>. Grunt is basically a task-based command line tool you write using JavaScript and it’s built on top of Node.js. Up to the time before I started building this blog, I just used Grunt to combine CSS files and minify them, which is elementary compared to the other possibilities with Grunt. Now, after completing this site (for the most part), I feel like I have a descent Grunt workflow. In the coming months I want to expand more on the possibilities with automation in my workflow, and ultimately have a solid process that works for me and my projects.</p>

<p>Anyone in the web design community will know that JavaScript has come a long way and with the likes of frameworks such as <a href="%09http://www.emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, <a href="%09http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, <a href="%09https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a>, etc. its almost crazy not to have a MVC framework under your belt. This year I would like to find one of the above or possibly some other framework that works for me to build apps easily as possible. I would also like to get in the habit of writing pure Javascript, when possible, in order to learn how the language works besides jumping straight to jQuery for simple tasks.</p>

<p>Mainly I just like to get better at what I do and continue learning, and never stopping! Oh, yeah and continue blogging on here.</p>
